## Project Synopsis

### Problem Statement
As cryptocurrency adoption grows in Ethiopia and other emerging markets, trust remains a major barrier. Crypto platforms often face challenges with identity fraud, fake accounts, and lack of regulatory compliance — leading to security issues and user hesitancy. Most platforms lack integration with national ID systems, making it difficult to verify users in a trustworthy, local context.

### Planned Solution
**Faydex** is a cryptocurrency trading platform built with trust at its core. Every user is verified through Ethiopia’s national identity system, **Fayda**, using secure OIDC integration. The platform will provide a safe, easy-to-use environment for trading digital assets, ensuring compliance and minimizing fraud. Users can register with their Fayda ID, explore market data, and trade with confidence — all while knowing their identity and transactions are protected.

### Expected Outcome
- Establish a secure and compliant crypto trading experience for Ethiopian users.
- Build user confidence by integrating verified national IDs into account creation.
- Support financial inclusion by making crypto accessible and trusted.
- Set a foundation for future features like fiat-to-crypto gateways and expanded payment integrations.

### Fayda’s Role
Fayda is central to our platform's identity verification and trust model. By integrating Fayda’s OIDC authentication, we ensure that only real, verified individuals can participate in crypto trading. This helps reduce fraud, increases security, and aligns the platform with national regulations — a major step forward for localized crypto innovation.
