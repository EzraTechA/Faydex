## Project Synopsis

### Problem Statement
Crypto trading platforms often struggle with identity fraud, fake accounts, and regulatory compliance. This reduces trust and slows adoption, especially in emerging markets like Ethiopia where national identity verification is not commonly integrated into fintech platforms.

### Planned Solution
Faydex is a cryptocurrency trading platform that requires all users to verify their identities through the national Fayda ID system. By integrating Fayda’s government-verified identity service, we aim to build a secure, compliant, and trustworthy crypto exchange tailored for local users. Features include user registration via Fayda, a simple trading interface, and secure transaction monitoring.

### Expected Outcome
- Provide a safe and compliant crypto trading experience for Ethiopian users.
- Increase trust in cryptocurrency platforms via national ID verification.
- Enable financial inclusion by making crypto accessible with strong security.
- Lay groundwork for future expansion with local payment integration and advanced trading features.

### Fayda’s Role
Fayda’s national ID system is core to our platform’s security and trust. Every user will be authenticated and verified using Fayda’s OIDC integration, ensuring that only legitimate, verified individuals can create accounts and trade.
